# OIBSIP_JavaDevelopment_Task1

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a *Digital Library Management System* using *Java in Eclipse IDE*.  
This application allows *admins and users* to manage and access books efficiently, with features like viewing books, searching, issuing, returning, and submitting queries.

## Features
### *Admin:*
- Admin Login (credentials can be set in the code)
- Manage the collection of books (add, update, delete)
- Monitor issued/returned books

### *User:*
1. *View Books* – See the available books and their issued status.  
2. *Search Book by Title* – Find books by title easily.  
3. *Issue Book* – Borrow books by ID.  
4. *Return Book* – Return previously borrowed books.  
5. *Send Email Query* – Submit questions (simulated email system).

## Steps Performed
1. Created a *Java console application* using *Eclipse IDE*.  
2. Designed classes for *Book, User, Admin, and Library Management*.  
3. Implemented features like *viewing, searching, issuing, returning, and querying books*.  
4. Added a *menu-driven interface* for both *Admin and User dashboards*.  
5. Tested the system with sample data and ensured smooth operation.

## Outcome
The *Digital Library Management System* allows users and admins to:
- Efficiently manage books (view, search, issue, return).
- Handle basic queries via a simulated email system.
- Provide a *simple, interactive menu-driven interface*.
